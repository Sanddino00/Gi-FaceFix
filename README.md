# Gi-FaceFix



Small fix for the broken face textures after the 6.1 update.

This should fix the disappearing face textures and weird cirles on the cheeks.

How to use:


Put the Script or .exe in your mod folder or other folder containing the broken mod / mods and run it.

To run the script type:
py FaceFixV(x).py to make an automatic backup or py FaceFixV(x).py -nobackup do disable the backup.



The exe will use the current one and will ask if it should scan Subfolders for .ini files which need changing. It will show all files which need a change and you will need to press y to start updating the files or n to abort the process.
You can also exclude folders with mods which either break or don't need an update.
