# Gi-FaceFix



Small fix for the broken face textures after the 6.1 update.

This should fix the disappearing face textures and weird cirles on the cheeks.

How to use:


- Put it inside the mod or character folder.
- I recommend individual characters folder.
 - Run py FaceFixV(...).py or if you want no backup of the ini py FaceFix(...).py -nobackup 
or just run the exe.
- To exclude folders simply typ the the folder name or names which should be excluded and press enter.

The script fixes the small rings on character faces, should stop textures on the face like makeup from disappearing after a few seconds and it creats an automatic backup before editing the ini so you can easily fix it if something goes wrong. 
The script should work with merged mods but I am not to sure about more complex mods.
If you find any bugs please let me know.
